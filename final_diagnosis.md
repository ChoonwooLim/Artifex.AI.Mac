# Performance Issue Final Diagnosis

## Current Status
- **Branch**: well (but with main's simple attention.py)
- **Attention Performance**: Fast (0.1-1.7ms for typical sizes)
- **Generation Performance**: Very slow (1 hour for 30%)

## Key Findings

### 1. Attention Implementation
- **Well branch attention**: Complex with preprocessing (slow in theory)
- **Main branch attention**: Simple PyTorch SDPA (fast in theory)
- **Current**: Using main's simple attention on well branch
- **Result**: Attention itself is FAST, but generation is still SLOW

### 2. This means the problem is NOT in attention.py

### 3. Possible Root Causes

#### A. Environment Variables
```
WAN_FORCE_FP16: Not set
WAN_COMPILE: Not set
```
These might need to be set for performance.

#### B. Model Loading or Offloading
- Check if model offloading is causing slowdowns
- Check if dtype conversions are happening repeatedly

#### C. Memory Management
- GPU memory is barely used (4.3%)
- This suggests model might be running on CPU or constantly swapping

#### D. Branch Differences
Files that differ between well and main:
- generate.py (fps_override removed in main)
- model.py (s2v support added in main)
- Various s2v modules

## Next Steps to Find Root Cause

1. **Run with explicit environment variables**:
   ```
   SET WAN_FORCE_FP16=1
   SET WAN_COMPILE=0
   python generate.py ...
   ```

2. **Check if model is actually on GPU**:
   - Add logging to see device placement
   - Monitor GPU memory during generation

3. **Compare actual execution between branches**:
   - Run same command on well branch
   - Run same command on main branch
   - Profile and compare

4. **Check for hidden dtype conversions**:
   - FP32 -> FP16 conversions can be very slow
   - Especially if happening every iteration

## Most Likely Cause
The model is either:
1. Not properly utilizing GPU (running on CPU)
2. Constantly moving data between CPU and GPU
3. Doing expensive dtype conversions repeatedly
4. Using offload_model=True by default (when it should be False)
